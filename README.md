## Features

- **DNA-to-RNA Conversion**:
  - Convert DNA sequences to RNA with optional cleaning (remove gaps, N's, and invalid characters).
  - Preserve or clean sequences based on user preferences.

- **Quality Control**:
  - Sequence length validation.
  - GC content analysis with warnings for high/low GC.
  - Detection of gaps, homopolymers, and invalid characters.

- **Advanced RNA Analysis**:
  - **Codon Usage**: Analyze codon frequencies and generate interactive visualizations.
  - **ORF Finder**: Identify open reading frames (ORFs) in RNA sequences.
  - **Poly-A Tail Detection**: Detect and analyze poly-A tails in mRNA sequences.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - GC content pie chart.
  - Nucleotide frequency bar chart.
  - Dinucleotide frequency heatmap.
  - Positional nucleotide distribution.
  - Sequence complexity analysis.
  - Homopolymer distribution.

- **Data Export**:
  - Download RNA sequences in FASTA format.
  - Export sequence statistics and QC reports in CSV format.

## Usage

1. **Input DNA Sequence**:
   - Paste your DNA sequence into the input box.
   - Choose whether to auto-clean the sequence (remove gaps, N's, and invalid characters).

2. **Convert to RNA**:
   - Click the "Process Sequence" button to convert DNA to RNA.

3. **Explore Results**:
   - View the RNA sequence and detailed statistics in the **RNA Output** tab.
   - Use the **Analytics** tab to explore interactive visualizations.
   - Perform advanced RNA analysis (codon usage, ORF finding, poly-A tail detection) in the **RNA Analysis** tab.

4. **Download Results**:
   - Download the RNA sequence in FASTA format.
   - Export sequence statistics and QC reports in CSV format.
